Notes for the GENENTECH talk.

- Tell more of a story about the data, and show a photo of SF, and some weather instruments.

Once I reveal the missingness mechanism, introduce the gifs:

- doppelganger on a plane
- frisbee in a basketball hoop
- cricket in a bin
- golf ball openinng a beer bottle.

Then, say that working with missing data is like:

dart throw

And I want it to be this pit of success:

insert slide from Hadley

which would look like this:

- something awesome and successful.

So, my point is that, before you discuss the ideas of an ideal analysis, you should be thinking about how to answer questions like:

1. Start looking at missing data
1. Explore different reasons for why data is missing

Whilst ensuring that the things you use are:

1. Easy to use
1. Quick to remember
1. Complement existing tools

Other things to include:

- gif of naniar
- #34 re-work the shadow shift, and show the data visualisation, then the data? 
- #41 introduce imputation (before this, summarise point two, we can explore missing
- #42 discuss simputation 


I want to add:
* `replace_with_na`

Include future work

* more `geom_miss`
* tidy multiple imputation
* graphical inference from `nullabor`.

* add icons for twitter, github, emails.

Minor formatting notes:

- use a different colour scheme than white text on blue
- images and gifs should be full screen
- make code chunks bigger text
